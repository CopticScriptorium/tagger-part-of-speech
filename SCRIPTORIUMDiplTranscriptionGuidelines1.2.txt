1. Preamble
This document details guidelines for transcribing a diplomatic edition of a manuscript in Sahidic Coptic according to the Coptic SCRIPTORIUM project scheme.  The diplomatic transcription currently requires extensive manual annotation, due to the complexities of processing a diplomatic text in which no word breaks exist in the original and yet words and even morphemes span across line, column, and page breaks.
The transcription procedure assumes familiarity with basic paleography and traditional manuscript transcription following the Leiden conventions.  (http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/app-glossary.html#leiden)
The diplomatic transcription also utilizes XML (eXtensible Markup Language) -like tagsets, including some of the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML markup language, although the resulting document is not a valid XML document.  Wherever possible, the EpiDoc subset of TEI XML is utilized for element nomenclature.  EpiDoc TEI conventions were created by and for epigraphers and have come to be a standard in markup of ancient texts, epigraphic or otherwise. (http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/)  In contrast to TEI, SCRIPTORIUM utilizes no milestone XML tags (e.g., <cb/>). Instead, all tags are span annotations (e.g., <cb>This is a column of Coptic text.</cb>).
We recommend using an XML editor such as Oxygen to ensure the encoding is well-formed and well-structured.
The aim is twofold: 1) to achieve a transcription that documents the text and visualization of the manuscript as closely as possible to the original; 2) to provide a text file that can be processed by various digital tools and software, such as a tokenizer, a part-of-speech tagger, or the ANNIS database infrastructure (http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/annis/; Zeldes et al. 2009).  The resulting transcription itself does not resemble a traditional text of a diplomatic edition.  The markup ensures optimization for processing and search using such tools and software.  For examples of the diplomatic editions visualized in HTML generated from the post-ANNIS transformations, see the sample corpora at http://www.copticscriptorium.org. Valid EpiDoc TEI XML versions of the documents are also provided from this site.
2. Character Encoding
Texts are encoded using the UTF-8 (Unicode) Coptic language character set.  The freely available Antinoou font and Coptic-English keyboard created by Michael Everson in cooperation with the International Association of Coptic Studies is the standard  (http://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/).  Unicode characters in the private use area are not recommended.
2.1 Alphanumeric Characters
Characters follow the orthography of the manuscript.
Typically the uppercase version of the character is used for oversized characters unless they are extremely large, in which case the character is encoded with the appropriate EpiDoc TEI XML tag (e.g., hi@rend=“large”); see section 5 on character rendering, especially 5.1.
2.2 Punctuation and Decoration
Punctuation and decoration follows the manuscript as closely as possible within the Unicode character set.  Not all decoration and punctuation can be encoded using characters; deviations or documentation that can’t be keyed in is instead typically indicated in a note element.  
Notes on individual specific punctuation characters:
For the character ⳿ that occasionally appears at the end of words in some manuscripts, use U+2CFF: 
	Example:  ⲡⲉⲙⲙⲟⲛ⳿ⲧⲉ
2.3 Accentuation and Supralinear Strokes
Accentuation and supralinear strokes follow the orthography of the manuscript.  Some manuscripts have binding strokes between letters (e.g. ϩ︤ⲛ︥) whereas others in the case of the same word might only provide a stroke over a single letter (e.g., ϩⲛ̄).  The diplomatic transcription follows the conventions of the manuscript, even if the manuscript is internally inconsistent or contains what seem to be errors.
Notes on encoding individual specific accents, strokes, etc, using the Coptic-English keyboard for Antinoou (for MacIntosh):
̄ (as in ⲙ̄) the supralinear stroke above only one letter: type the letter followed by Unicode U+0304 (; on keyboard)
︤︥ (as in ⲙ︤ⲛ︥) the binding stroke between two letters: type first letter then U+FE24 (< in the Coptic-English keyboard) then second letter then  U+FE25 (> in the Coptic-English keyboard), i.e. m<n> on a Mac using the Coptic-English keyboard
︤ ︦ ︥ (as in ⲙ︤ⲛ︦ⲧ︥) binding stroke over three letters: type the first letter then U+FE24 (< on a Mac using the Coptic-English keyboard) then second letter then U+FE26 (: [i.e. shift+;] on a Mac using the Coptic-English keyboard) then third letter then U+FE25 (> on a Mmac using the Coptic-English keyboard), i.e. m<n:t>)
᷍  (as in ⲟ᷍ⲩ) circumflex combining two letters: U+1DCD (keystroke shift+option+/ on a Mac using the Coptic-English keyboard) typed between the letters, so o¿u (o then shift+option+/ then u)
For squiggly, curved, or jagged strokes over etas, use a regular circumflex rather than a dot or line or trema (  ̂): type the letter followed by U+0302 (option+3 on the Mac keyboard).
Tremas (ⲓ̈, ⲏ̈): type the letter followed by U+0308 (option+7 on the Mac keyboard).

3. Text Divisions
A diplomatic transcription aims to preserve the formatting of the original text.  Line breaks, column breaks, and page breaks as they appear in the manuscript are all documented.
3.1 Line Breaks
All line breaks in the transcription should follow the line breaks of the manuscript.  When the “Enter” or “Return” key is used to create a line break in the text file of the transcription, automated processing of the text file should convert them into encoded line breaks (e.g., the lb element in TEI).  
3.2 Column Breaks
All column breaks in the transcription should follow the column divisions in the manuscript.  Columns are wrapped in span annotations using the <cb></cb> tagset.
Fig. 1: Opening column break tag, corresponding to beginning of manuscript column
MONB.YA 520; Coptic Manuscript IB 2 f. 27v, Naples, Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele IIIFig. 2: Closing column break tag, corresponding to the end of a manuscript text column
 MONB.YA 520; Coptic Manuscript IB 2 f. 27v, Naples, Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele III,”
3.3 Page Breaks and Numbering
All page breaks in the transcription should follow the page divisions in the manuscript.  Page numbering in the transcription reflects the page numbering in the original manuscript codex.  Codex sigla in the example below are two-letter codes following the White Monastery codex siglum list created by Tito Orlandi (Orlandi 2002; http://cmcl.aai.uni-hamburg.de/). Page breaks are wrapped in TEI compatible span annotations using the <pb></pb> tagset with the xml:id element.  The entire page of text (including the relevant column tags) should be wrapped with these tags.  Thus <pb xml:id="YA518"> is the opening tag for page 518 in White Monastery codex YA (MONB.YA).  The xml:id should not contain spaces.  (Thus, xml:id="YA518" not xml:id="YA 518">.)
Fig. 3: Closing and opening page break tags indicating the end of one page and beginning of the next. (Note:  the opening tag for the first page and closing tag for the second page are not visible here but are required.) 

The location and Coptic numeration of the page number may be documented in a note element.  (See Figure 3 above).
4. Word Segmentation, Spacing, and Tokenization
Please see the Word Segmentation and Tokenization Guidelines.
Sahidic Coptic bound groups are formed by several words and/or morphemes attaching together.  A word refers to one noun, preposition, article, etc.  One complex word can be comprised of multiple morphemes, including affixes such as ⲁⲧ, ⲙⲛⲧ, or ⲣⲉϥ, or compound words, such as complex numbers (e.g. -teens) and verbs formed with ⲣ.  One bound group may include multiple prepositions and objects, or a verbal auxiliary + subject + infinitive, or even more words and morphemes strung together (generally speaking clitics).  The copula, which some might consider a clitic, remains unbound.  Coptic SCRIPTORIUM follows the practices in Bentley Layton’s grammar (Layton 2011) for word, morpheme, and bound group segmentation.
Examples of individual words comprised of one morpheme:
ⲥⲱⲧⲙ
ⲛⲟⲃⲉ
ϩⲏⲧ
Examples of individual words comprised of multiple morphemes:
ⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙ
ⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉ
Examples of bound groups comprised of words with multiple morphemes:
ⲧⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙ
ⲙⲡⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉ
ⲡⲣⲙⲛϩⲏⲧ
ϫⲉⲛⲧⲁⲩϫⲓⲧⲥ
Note:  if a project wishes to annotate on the morpheme level (i.e. internal analysis of units like ⲙⲛⲧ) and not just on the word level, the morphemes need to be tokenized.  Coptic SCRIPTORIUM annotates on the word level and then provides additional annotation on the morpheme level for compound words and words with affixes.  (See section 4.4 for more information.)
In most manuscripts, no spaces between words or bound groups are provided.  Sometimes a diacritical mark, such as  ̀ does appear, but word segmentation following diacritics and punctuation does not always correspond with contemporary segmentation practices (such as Layton or Till (1960). More study of this marking is required. 
4.1 Word Segmentation
SCRIPTORIUM diplomatic transcription marks word segmentations according to Layton’s conventions (Layton 2011).  The transcriber inserts an underscore (“_”) after each Coptic bound group, even when the end of the bound group falls at the end of a line.  
Likewise, all punctuation is followed by an underscore.
(1) ⲉⲧⲉⲓ̈ⲥⲙⲁⲏⲗ_  (word ends at end of line)
(2) ⲡⲉ_ⲛϥⲛⲁⲕⲗⲏ (two words, in which the second bound group flows into line 3)
(3) ⲣⲟⲛⲟⲙⲉⲓ_ⲙ (the bound group continues from line 2, is followed by an underscore)
(4) ⲙⲟⲕ_ⲁⲛ_·_ (punctuation followed by an underscore)
These underscores are not and do not need to be visualized in HTML transformations of the diplomatic editions; they are nonetheless essential for processing the text, since they demark breaks between bound groups and will enable searches and visualizations of a word-segmented text.
4.2 Spacing
Blank spaces in the transcription correspond to spaces in the manuscript.  Consequently, if the manuscript provides no spaces between words or punctuation, the diplomatic transcription contains no spaces.  Where there are significant spaces in the manuscript that the transcriber wishes to draw attention to, the transcription should encode a space using TEI XML tags in order to visualize the white space in the manuscript.  Encode the word, morpheme, or punctuation next to the white space, as in these examples:
(1) <hi rend="1_space_right">·</hi> will visualize one space to the right of the ·
(2) ⲛ̄|<hi rend="1_space_right">ⲃⲟⲏⲑⲟⲥ</hi> will visualize one space to the right of he n t
(3) ϫⲱ|<hi rend="2_space_right">ⲓ̈</hi>_<hi rend="1_space_right">·_</hi>_ⲉⲧⲃⲉ_ will visualize two spaces to the right of ⲓ̈ and one space to the right of the ·
It is important to make sure that attributes are surrounded by straight, not curly quotes (i.e. " on both sides).
4.3 Tokenization of Words
Bound groups are segmented into words using the pipe character (“|”).
(1) ϩⲓⲧⲙ|ⲡ|ⲛⲟⲩⲧⲉ_ (preposition|article|noun)(2) ⲉⲧⲉ|ⲓ̈ⲥⲙⲁⲏⲗ_ (converter|noun)(3) ⲡⲉ⳿_ⲛ|ϥ|ⲛⲁ|ⲕⲗⲏ (word_auxiliary|subject pronoun|future marker|verb (verb continues to line 4)(4) ⲣⲟⲛⲟⲙⲉⲓ⳿_ⲙ̄
4.4 Tokenizing and Annotating Morphemes below the Word Level
To conduct research on the morpheme level in compound words or other words that contain multiple morphemes, the words will need to be tokenized and annotated below the word level and on the morpheme level.  In Coptic SCRIPTORIUM, text is annotated on the word level for the part of speech (see SCRIPTORIUM Part-of-Speech Tagsets for Sahidic Coptic) and other characteristics, such as language of origin.  Tokenizing and annotating on the morpheme level allows for additional search, visualization, and research capabilities.
Examples of individual words comprised of multiple morphemes, tokenized on the morpheme level:
wordⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙmorphemeⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙ
wordⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉmorphemeⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉ	
       Examples of bound groups comprised of words with multiple morphemes:
bound groupⲧⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙwordⲧⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙmorphemeⲧⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙ
bound groupⲙⲡⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉwordⲙⲡⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉmorphemeⲙⲡⲣⲉϥⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉ
bound groupⲡⲣⲙⲛϩⲏⲧwordⲡⲣⲙⲛϩⲏⲧmorphemeⲡⲣⲙⲛϩⲏⲧ
Compound words that involve an article or affixed personal pronoun to the second item of the compound typically are tokenized as bound groups comprised of multiple words, not as one word comprised of multiple morphemes.  
Examples of bound groups containing compound words with articles or pronouns on the second unit of the compound:
bound group/compoundⲣϩⲛⲁϥwordⲣϩⲛⲁϥno tokenization & annotation on the morpheme level below the word level

bound groupⲙⲡⲉⲧⲛⲣⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉwordⲙⲡⲉⲧⲛⲣⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉno tokenization & annotation on the morpheme level below the word level(where ⲣⲡⲙⲉⲉⲩⲉ is considered to contain multiple words, not morphemes below one word level)
[Note:  the part-of-speech tagger developed by Coptic SCRIPTORIUM operates on the word level, not the sub-word morpheme level.  So, ⲣϩⲟⲧⲉ is tagged as one V, ⲙⲛⲧⲁⲧⲥⲱⲧⲙ as one N, etc.]


5.  Rendering and Leiden Transcription Conventions
Coptic SCRIPTORIUM uses Leiden and Leiden+ conventions for transcribing manuscripts.  The encoding follows the EpiDoc guidelines.  Not all Leiden documentation is currently XML encoded as Leiden+, however.
5.1 Characters Highlighted, Raised, Lowered, or Set Apart in Some Way
Characters that are raised, lowered, or printed in different colors or styles are encoded using the TEI XML element <hi> with the rend attribute.  Letters written above the line are encoded: <hi rend="superscript">.  Characters written below the line are encoded: <hi rend="subscript">.  Letters in a different color ink are encoded with the color ink, e.g., <hi rend="red">. It is possible to combine these annotations, e.g. <hi rend="red subscript">. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM currently encodes large, tall (the letter stretches above the line), long (letter stretches below the line), thin, superscript, subscript, and colors.  Any additional information can be provided in a note element.  To encode two attributes, use a space (not a comma) between the two attributes.
Example
ϩⲓⲧ︤ⲙ︥|ⲡ|ⲛ<hi rend="superscript"><note note="ⲟ is directly above the ⲩ">ⲟ</note></hi>ⲩ
ⲡ|ⲡ|ⲉⲧ|ⲛⲁⲛⲟ<hi rend="large">ⲩ</hi>|<hi rend= "long thin">ϥ</hi>_._Diplomatic Visualization
ϩⲓⲧ︤ⲙ︥ⲡⲛⲟⲩ (ANNIS) or 
ϩⲓⲧ︤ⲙ︥ⲡⲛ\ⲟ/ⲩ (EpiDoc XSLT)


Other  encodings are colors (red, brown, green, etc.)  “ekthetic” should be used for characters that are part of the ongoing text but written to the left of the margin line.  See below, in which the ⲡ is encoded <hi rend=“red ekthetic”>Ⲡ</hi>
 
hi@rend cannot contain more than five words as per Epidoc guidelines and may contain only alphanumeric characters.  (No punctuation.  So <hi rend= "long, thin">ϥ</hi> is invalid.)
5.2 Damaged Characters
Characters that are damaged but restored based on context are marked with an underdot.  Coptic SCRIPTORIUM uses the diacritical character   ̣ (Unicode U+0323).  These characters are not currently encoded in TEI XML using the EpiDoc tagset for Leiden+. Coptic SCRIPTORIUM uses the underdot character rather than annotation to designate this information.
5.3 Lacunae and Lost Characters
Lost lines and characters (lacunae) are indicated using square brackets, as in the Leiden conventions.  They may be encoded using the EpiDoc tagset, but it is not required. See EpiDoc guidelines for more details (“EpiDoc Guidelines: Lost Characters, Quantity Unknown”; “EpiDoc Guidelines: Editorial Restoration: Characters Lost but Restored by Modern Editor”; “EpiDoc Guidelines: Lost Characters, Quantity Approximate”; “EpiDoc Guidelines: Lost Characters, Quantity Known”; “EpiDoc Guidelines: Erased and Lost”; “EpiDoc Guidelines: Lacunas, Other Units”).
(1) Example encoded using the gap element:
<gap reason="lost">
[ ]_
[ ]_
[ ]_
</gap>
(2) Unencoded gaps (no XML elements):
[.....]ⲡ̣ⲣ̣[..]

5.4 Other
Other rendering information is encoded either according to EpiDoc conventions or recorded as information within a note element.  See the cheatsheet for Leiden+ conventions in EpiDoc at http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/guidelines/msword/cheatsheet.doc and http://papyri.info/editor/documentation?docotype=text.  See also the full list of text transcription guidelines here http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/app-alltrans.html.
Transcribing in Oxygen or a similar XML editor is recommended, to ensure tags are well-structured.
6.0 File Format and Document Preferences
Documents are transcribed in a text editor such as TextEdit.  Document preferences are set to UTF-8 encoding without byte-order Mark (BOM).  (E.g., in TextEdit 1.7.1 for MacIntosh, in the File-->Preferences menu, click on “Open and Save,” and select “Unicode (UTF-8)” for Opening files and Saving files.)
